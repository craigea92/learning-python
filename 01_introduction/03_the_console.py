THE CONSOLE

The "console" is a panel that displays important messages, like errors or the text output of a program. 
If we want to see what's happening in our code, we need to print it to the console by using the print() function.

We'll learn more about functions later, but for now, just know that the print() function will print anything you put inside its parentheses.
