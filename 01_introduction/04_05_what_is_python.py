WHAT IS PYTHON?

Thousands of students start their coding journey right here with Python. 
We think it's the best programming language to get started with. 
Python is famous for being a simple language that's easy to read and write.

However, just because it's simple that doesn't mean it's not useful! 
Python is an extremely popular language in the industry, and is well-known for:

Backend web servers
DevOps and cloud engineering
Machine learning
Scripting and automation
etc...

On the other hand, it's not particularly well-known for front-end work. 
While it's possible to do so, Python isn't typically used to build visual user interfaces.
