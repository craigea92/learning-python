WHAT IS CODE

Code is just a series of instructions that computers can folow. 
Computers obey each instruction, one after another.

Programs can be comprised of many instructions.
Like many, Like millions.

Addition is one of the most common instructions in coding.

print("some text here")

# but it can also print numbers without quotes:
print(1)

# and you can do math directly inside the parenthesis:
print(1 + 2)

# Assignment
# Calculate and print the result of 250 + 75

# Solution
print(250 + 75)
