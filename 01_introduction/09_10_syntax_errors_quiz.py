SYNTAX ERRORS QUIZ

Syntax in programming are the rules that define what properly structured expressions and statements look like in that language. 
For example, in Python, the following would be considered correct syntax:

print("hello world")

While in a different programming language, like Go, the correct syntax would be:

fmt.Println("hello world")

Code can have many different problems that prevent it from working as intended. 

Some examples include:
A bug in the logic. For example, a program that should add numbers together, but instead multiplies them.
A problem with speed. A program that calculates how to play the perfect game of chess might never be able to finish because it requires too many calculations.
A problem with syntax. This is the most common problem for new developers. 
Luckily the Python interpreter will try to give you a descriptive error message in the console to help you find the problem.
