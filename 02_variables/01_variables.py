VARIABLES

Variables are how we store data in our program. 
So far we've been directly printing data by passing it directly into the print() function.

Now we are going to learn to save the data in variables so we can use and change it before we need to print it.

A variable is a name that we define that will point to some data. 
For example, I could define a new variable called my_height and set its value to 100. 
I could also define a variable called my_name and set it equal to "Lane".

# CREATING VARIABLES
# To create a new variable in Python we use the following syntax:

my_new_variable_two = 2
this_can_be_called_anything = 3

# Assignment
# Create a new variable named player_health and set it to 1000

# Solution
player_health = 1000
print(player_health)
