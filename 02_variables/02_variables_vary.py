VARIABLES VARY

Variables are called "variables" because they can hold any value and that value can change (it varies).

For example, the following will print 20:

acceleration = 10
acceleration = 20
print(acceleration)

The line acceleration = 20 reassigns the value of acceleration to 20. 
It overwrites whatever was being held in the acceleration variable before.

# Assignment
# Before each print() function in the provided code, change the value of player_health to 100 less than it was before.

player_health = 1000
print(player_health)

# here
print(player_health)

# here
print(player_health)

# here
print(player_health)

# Solution
player_health = 1000
print(player_health)

player_health = 900
print(player_health)

player_health = 800
print(player_health)

player_health = 700
print(player_health)
