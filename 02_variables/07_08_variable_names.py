VARIABLE NAMES

Variable names can't have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

In Python you should use "snake_case" when creating variable names - it's become the rule of thumb for the language.
By way of comparison, "camelCase" is where the beginning of each new word except the first is capitalized.

CAMEL CASE
someVariableHere = 10

SNAKE CASE
some_variable_here = 10
