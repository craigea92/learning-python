NONETYPE VARIABLES

Not all variables have a value. We can declare an "empty" variable by setting it to None.

empty = None

The value of empty in this instance is None until we use the assignment operator, =, to give it a value.

NONE IS NOT A SPECIFIC STRING

Note that the NoneType is not the same as a string with a value of "None":

my_none = None # This is a None-type
my_none = "None" # This is a string
"""

# Assignment
# Declare a variable named enemy and set it to None

# Solution
enemy = None
print(enemy is None)
