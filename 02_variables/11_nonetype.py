NONETYPE

As we mentioned in the last exercise, the None keyword is used to define an empty (or "null") variable or object.
In Python, the None keyword is an object, and it is a data type of the class NoneType

Common use case: representing a variable without a chosen value yet, such as in user onboarding for selecting age.
Avoiding common mistake: When printing the "None" type, it can be confused with the string "None".
Solution: Use the 'type()' function to determine the type of a variable, especially when debugging code.
