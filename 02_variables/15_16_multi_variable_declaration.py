"""
MULTI-VARIABLE DECLARATION

We can save space when creating many new variables by declaring them on the same line:

sword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = "Excalibur", 10, 200

Which is the same as:

sword_name = "Excalibur"
sword_damage = 10
sword_length = 200

Any number of variables can be declared on the same line. 
Variables declared on the same line should be related to one another in some way so that the code remains easy to understand.

We call code that's easy to understand "clean code".
