LEARNING EFFECTIVELY

There's no way around it, if programming were a walk in the park everyone would be earning 6 figures as a software engineer. 
But it's not, and to succeed without getting stuck and frustrated you need to learn how to learn.

RED, GREEN, REFACTOR

The red, green, refactor approach helps developers compartmentalize their focus into three phases:

Red — think about what you want to develop
Green — think about how to make your tests pass
Refactor — think about how to improve your existing implementation

Don't be afraid to add print() statements while writing code, it may help later when debugging!
