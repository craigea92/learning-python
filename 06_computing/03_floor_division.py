FLOOR DIVISION

Python has great out-of-the-box support for mathematical operations. 
This, among other reasons, is why it has had such success in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

Floor division is like normal division except the result is floored afterward, which means the remainder is removed. 
As you would expect, this means the result is an integer instead of a float.
