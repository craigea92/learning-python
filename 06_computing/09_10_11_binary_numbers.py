BINARY NUMBERS

Binary numbers are just "base 2" numbers. They work the same way as "normal" base 10 numbers, but with 2 symbols instead of 10.

Each 1 in a binary number represents a greater multiple of 2. 
In a 4-digit number, that means you have the eight's place, the four's place, the two's place, and the one's place. 
Similar to how in decimal you would have the thousandth's place, the hundredth's place, the ten's place, and the one's place.

0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0011 = 3
0100 = 4
0101 = 5
0110 = 6
0111 = 7
1000 = 8
