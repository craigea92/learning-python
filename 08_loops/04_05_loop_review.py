# Question 01

# Why would you want to use a loop?

# To do the same thing over and over without writing the same code
# Because the computer understands loops better than repetitive code
# Because loops speed up your app

# Answer = To do the same thing over and over without writing the same code

# Question 02

# Why does the code on the left print 0-999 and not 0-1000?

# Because print(i) only happens while i is less than or equal to 1000
# Because print(i) only happens while i is less then (not equal to) 1000
# Because print(i) only happens while i is greater than or equal to 1000
# Because print(i) only happens while i is greater than (not equal to) 1000

# Answer = Because print(i) only happens while i is less then (not equal to) 1000
