WHITESPACE IN PYTHON

The body of a for-loop must be indented, otherwise you'll get a syntax error. 
Not only that, but every line in the body of the loop must be indented in the same way - we use the "4 spaces" convention. 
Pressing the <tab> key should automatically insert 4 spaces.

Whitespace matters in Python.
