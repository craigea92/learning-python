ACCESSING DICTIONARY VALUES

Dictionary elements must be accessible somehow in code, otherwise they wouldn't be very useful.
A value is retrieved from a dictionary by specifying its corresponding key in square brackets. 
The syntax looks similar to indexing into a list.

car = {
    'make': 'tesla',
    'model': '3'
}
print(car['make'])
# Prints: tesla
