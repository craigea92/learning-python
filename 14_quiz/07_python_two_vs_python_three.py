PYTHON 2 VS PYTHON 3
One thing that's important to keep in mind as you continue your Python journey is that the Python ecosystem suffers from split personality syndrome. 
Python 3 was released on December 3rd, 2008, but over a decade later the web is still full of Python 2 dependencies, scripts and tutorials.

PYTHON 2
print "hello world"

PYTHON 3
print("hello world")
